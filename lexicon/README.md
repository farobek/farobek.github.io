# Lexicon

Lexicon is a online text editor for composing ideas and sending them to yourself when you only have a public computer available.

##Problem
You are at university or in a cyber caf√© and you have this important text that you want to store. However, for security reasons or time constraints, you don't want to log in your email.

##Solution
Lexicon allows you to compose and email the text to yourself with a single click. This removes the need, delay and possible security risk of logging in your email in a public computer. You compose your text, you type your email and you press a button. That's all.

Faster and safer.
